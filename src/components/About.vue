    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Disbott is a chatbot for Discord, a primarily gaming based text &amp; voice chat software. Created originally by tomo in JS the project switch to using C# so fellow uchuu members could help out and allows us to better learn and help each other. Disbott is still in early days permissions need to be configured manually and it doesn't have persistent memory between versions &amp; downtime but the uchuu team are hard at work making this a great chatbot to use.</p>
    <p>If you have any feedback we'd love to hear! You can get in touch via our discord server, a Github Issue or via Twitter for those uchuu members that have one.</p>
    <p>We hope you enjoy Disbott!</p>
